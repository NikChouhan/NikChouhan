## Hi there 👋


_I'm Nikhil, a BTech student at IITR and an ardent open source lover. I love everything related to computer graphics and linux distros. Have some unpopular beliefs on everything related to computers. People may hate me for this but Gnome > KDE for everything_ :> <br/> 

- 🔭 _I’m currently working on my DX11 based renderer Spar._
- 🌱 _I’m currently learning DX11, Vulkan and computer graphics in general._
- 💬 _Ask me about anything Linux and Computer Graphics related._
- 📫 _Reach me at: nikhilchouhan2002@gmail.com_
